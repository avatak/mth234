    ~
    For a function \(f(x,y,z)\) the \emph{gradient vector} is 
    \begin{align*}
        \nabla f&= \gen{f_{x},f_{y},f_{z}}\\
            &= \gen{\pd{f}{x},\pd{f}{y},\pd{f}{z}}
    \end{align*}
    and the \emph{directional derivative} in the direction of a \textbf{unit vector} \(u\) is given by
    \begin{align*}
        D_{\bm{u}}f(x,y,z) & = \nabla f(x,y,z)\cdot \bm{u}
    \end{align*}

\question Let \(f(x,y)=\sin(2x+3y)\). Find the gradient of \(f\) and evaluate the gradient at the point \(P(-6,4)\). Find the rate of change of \(f\) at \(P\) in the direction of the vector \(u=\gen{\sqrt{3}/2,-1/2}\).
    \ifprintanswers
        \begin{solution}
            \[
                \nabla f = \gen{2\cos(2x+3y),3\cos(2x+3y)}\\
            \]
            So at \(P\) the gradient is 
            \[
                \nabla f(-6,4)=\gen{2\cos(0),3\cos(0)} = \gen{2,3}.
            \]
            Since \(\bu\) is a unit vector, we have 
            \[
                D_{\bu}f(-6,4) = \gen{2,3}\cdot \gen{\sqrt{3}/2,-1/2} = \sqrt{3}-\frac{3}{2}.
            \]

\question Find the directional derivative of \(f(x,y)=e^x\cos y\) at the point \((0,0)\) in the direction given by the angle \(\theta=\pi/4\).
    \ifprintanswers
        \begin{solution}
            The unit vector in the direction of \(\theta=\pi/4\) is \(\bu=\gen{\cos(\pi/4),\sin{\pi/4}}=\gen{\sqrt{2}/2,\sqrt{2}/2}\).
            From \(\nabla f=\gen{e^x\cos y,-e^x\sin y}\), 
            \[
                D_{\bu}f(0,0) = \gen{e^0\cos(0),-e^0\sin(0)}\cdot \gen{\sqrt{2}/2,\sqrt{2}/2}= \sqrt{2}/2.
            \]
            \end{solution}

\question Find the gradient of \(f(x,y,z)=x^2yz-xyz^3\). What is the rate of change of \(f\) at the point \(P(2,-1,1)\) in the direction of the point \((2,3,-2)\)?
    \ifprintanswers
        \begin{solution}
            The gradient is 
            \[
                \nabla f=\gen{2xyz-yz^3,x^2z-xz^3,x^2y-3xyz}
            \]
            The direction from \(P\) to \(Q\) is given by \(\gen{2-2,3-(-1),-2-1}=\gen{0,4,-3}\). A unit vector in that direction is \(\gen{0,4/5,-3/5}\).
            So the rate of change is given by
            \[
                \gen{2^2(-1)(1)-(-1)(1)^3,(2)^2(1)-(2)(1),2^2(-1)-3(2)(-1)(1)}\cdot \gen{0,4/5,-3/5} = \gen{-3,2,2}\cdot\gen{0,4/5,-3/5}=\frac{2}{5}.
            \]

\question 
\begin{parts}
    \part How do you find the maximum rate of change for a function \(f\) at a given point \((x_0,y_0,z_0)\)?
        \ifprintanswers
        \begin{solution}
            The maximum rate of change occurs in the direction \(\nabla f\) and is equal to \(|\nabla f|\).
        \end{solution}
    \else
        \vfill
    \fi 
    \part Let \(f(x,y)=xe^y\). Show that at the point \(P(2,0)\), the direction in which \(f\) is increasing the fastest is 
    in the direction \(\gen{1,2}\).
        \ifprintanswers
        \begin{solution}
            \(\nabla f=\gen{e^y,xe^y}\). At \(2,0\) this is \(\gen{1,2}\).
        \end{solution}
    \else
        \vfill

    \part What is the largest possible rate of change of \(f\) at the point \(P\)?
        \ifprintanswers
        \begin{solution}
            The largest possible rate of change is \(|\nabla f|=\sqrt{5}\).
        \end{solution}
    \else
        \vfill

\question Recall that for a diffentiable function \(f\) and any unit vector \(\bm{u}\)
\[
    D_uf = \nabla f\cdot \bm{u} = |\nabla f||\bm{u}|| \cos(\theta) = |\nabla f|\cos(\theta)
\] where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\nabla f\) and \(\bm{u}\).

\begin{parts}
\part Explain why the largest value of \(D_{\bm{u}} f\) occurs when \(\bm{u}\) is in the same direction as \(\nabla f\).
    \ifprintanswers
        \begin{solution}
            Since \(|\nabla f|\ge 0\) and \(-1\le \cos(\theta)\le 1\), the largest value occurs when \(\cos(\theta)=1\), i.e. \(\theta=0\). Which means the rate of change is maximized when the angle between \(\bu\) and \(\nabla f\) is \(0\) (i.e they are the same direction).
        \end{solution}
    \else
        \vfill
    \fi

\part In what direction is the rate of change of \(f\) minimized? Why?
    \ifprintanswers
        \begin{solution}
            Similar to above the rate is minimized \(\cos\theta=-1\) which occurs when \(\theta=\pi\), i.e. when \(\bu\) points in opposite direction of \(\nabla f\).
        \end{solution}
    \else
        \vfill
        \newpage

\question Find the maximum and minimum rates of change for \(f\) at the given point and the direction in which they occur
\begin{parts}
    \part \(f(x,y)=4y\sqrt{x}\) at \((4,1)\).
        \ifprintanswers
        \begin{solution}
            \(\nabla f=\gen{2y/\sqrt{x},4\sqrt{x}}\), so at \((4,1)\) 
            \(\nabla f(4,1)=\gen{1,8}\).

            The maximum rate of change occurs in the direction \(\gen{1,8}\) and has rate of change equal to \(\sqrt{65}\). The minimum rate of change occurs in the direction \(\gen{-1,-8}\) and has rate of change \(-\sqrt{65}\).
        \end{solution}
    \else
        \vfill

    \part \(f(x,y,z)=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}\) at \((3,6,-2)\).
        \ifprintanswers
        \begin{solution}
            \[\nabla f = \gen{\dfrac{x}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}},\dfrac{y}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}} },\dfrac{z}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}\]
            and
            \[
                \nabla f(3,6,-2) = \gen{\frac{3}{7},\frac{6}{7},-\frac{2}{7}}
            \]
            Maximum: \(1\) in direction \gen{\frac{3}{7},\frac{6}{7},-\frac{2}{7}},

            Minimum: \(-1\) in direction \gen{-\frac{3}{7},-\frac{6}{7},\frac{2}{7}}

\question Show that at every point on the line \(y=x+1\) the fastest rate of change for \(f(x,y)=x^2+y^2-2x-4y\) is in the direction \(\gen{1,1}\) and that this does not occur at any other point.
        \ifprintanswers
        \begin{solution}
        We need to find all points at which \(\nabla f\) points in the direction of \(\gen{1,1}\). First,
            \begin{align*}
                \nabla f & = \gen{2x-2,2y-4}
            \end{align*}
            Then \(\nabla f\) points in the direction \(\gen{1,1}\) if \(2x-2=2y-4\) which is equivalent to \(y=x+1\).
